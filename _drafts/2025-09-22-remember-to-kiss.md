*"Keep it simple stupid"*, or KISS for short - it's one of the things that is often taught to engineers. I remember clearly my first tech lead drilling this into me.
But still today, it's something that I find that I have to keep reminding myself of and this is a story of one of those times.

Last week I went for a drink with a good friend and fellow software engineer. I described to him the next challenge I was facing my personal project.
He was gracious enough at the time not to burst my bubble and point out the obvious - as all good coaches and leaders do. Instead only when I had 
reflected and slept on it I stumbled upon the obvious question myself - why do I need to run a headless Chrome to render a simple text-based PDF?
